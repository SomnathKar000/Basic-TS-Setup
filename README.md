Basic-TS-Setup: A Simple TypeScript Setup with Nodemon & TS-Node

This repository demonstrates a minimal setup for running TypeScript files seamlessly using nodemon and ts-node. The configuration allows automatic compilation and execution of TypeScript files whenever changes are detected.

Features
â€¢ Live reloading using nodemon
â€¢ TypeScript execution without manual compilation via ts-node
â€¢ Simple configuration with a nodemon.json file to watch .ts files in the src directory

Setup & Usage 1. Install dependencies:

npm install

    2.	Start development mode:

npm run dev

    3.	Place your TypeScript files inside the src/ folder. The entry point is src/index.ts.

This setup provides a lightweight way to work with TypeScript efficiently in a Node.js environment. ðŸš€
